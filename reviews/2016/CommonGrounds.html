      <h3>8/8/2016 - Common Grounds</h3>
      <img src=" http://placehold.it/300x200" alt="" />
  
      <p>Finished a graphic novel for my book club called Common Grounds (it also checked off a box on my reading checklist 2016 –graphic novel).</p>

<p>It is about a chain of coffee shops were super heroes and villains alike can come together and have food, drink and conversations because no fighting is allowed while in the establishment.</p>

<p>There are 13 different short stories and it took me a little while to get into the writing. But once I started to realize it's tongue in cheek comedy about super heroes..and that it also covers the human side of their lives and their struggles, then I really started to enjoy it.</p>

<p>I recommend this to anyone who would like to:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Try their first graphic novel - the panels are easy to follow.</li>
    <li>Likes a fast graphic novel - you could read it in 1 sitting.</li>
    <li>Have thought provoking discussions about the real lives of superheroes.</li>
</ol>
