      <h3>11/3/2016 - The Passage</h3>
      <img src=" http://placehold.it/300x200" alt="" />
  
      <p>It's not often that I re-read a book. The third book in The Passage Trilogy was released earlier this year and I finally went to pick it up...only to realize I hadn't read the other two books in years and wanted to remember all the details. So I just finished re-reading the first book in the series: The Passage.</p>

    <p>This is technically a vampire book...but not in the Dracula way...and thank God not in the Twilight way. It is a modern version with small links to the old tales.</p>

    <p>This book starts with how the government created vampire-like beings and then how they are released into the world. The second portion of the book flashes forward to how the people left in this desolate world survive. The third portion of the book has some survivors leave their safe haven to get a small girl back to where she originally came from and to also find a way to take care of the vampires for good.</p>

    <p>I'm also going to re-read the second book before finishing the trilogy. I will say...these books are VERY long! So I would recommend them to people who LOVE horror stories and avid readers. Don't be dismayed if you don't read quickly and still want to give it a shot though...just take you're time and enjoy the story...it's totally worth it!</p>
