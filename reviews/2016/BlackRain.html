      <h3>11/7/2016 - Black Rain</h3>
      <img src=" http://placehold.it/300x200" alt="" />
  
      <p>Just finished Black Rain by Matthew B.J. Delaney...it was pretty good.</p>

    <p>In the future, scientific companies trade cures for diseases for profit and A.I. robots who look like humans are bought to serve the "natural" human population. The main character finds out synthates aren't as far from human as everyone has been led to believe and that they are living as modern day slaves. He joins the synthate rebels to try and create a more just world.</p>

    <p>The story line gets better as the book goes on but my biggest complaint is the futuristic terms the author uses that just don't seem necessary a lot of times, which makes the writing feel a bit forced. Still a decent read. I would recommend it to anyone who loves novels about A.I. and how it doesn't always turn out like we plan.</p>
      
      <h4>Malia's Pizza Rating</h4>
      
      <p class="pr">A chicken pizza. Not what I normally gravitate towards, but not a bad choice either.</p>
