      <h3>12/6/2016 - The Autobiography of Malcom X</h3>
      <img src=" http://placehold.it/300x200" alt="" />
  
      <p>I've finally finished another book! The Autobiography of Malcom X.</p>

    <p>I'm not much for autobiographies, but after finishing this one I have found I am more interested in ones that are from a historical person and about someone that has really changed the course of history. </p>

    <p>There are more thoughts an emotions then I can even write down. I've learned a lot from this book. It was dense, long, and I often had to slow down to re-read a lot. I would love to read this book with a book club (especially one that is racially diverse) to see other's perspectives of Malcom's thoughts and beliefs.</p>

    <p>I think this is a book everyone should pick up if they are at all interested. It changed the way I thought of him and the civil rights movement. With all that is happening in our country, this is a great time to start this book and reflect on it.</p>
