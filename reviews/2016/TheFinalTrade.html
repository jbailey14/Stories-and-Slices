      <h3>10/3/2016 - The Final Trade: Book 2 in The Dominion Trilogy</h3>
      <img src=" http://placehold.it/300x200" alt="" />
  
        <p>Finished The Final Trade (book 2 in The Dominion Trilogy). It was REALLY good!</p>

    <p>For those that didn't read my first review....this series is set in a dystopian future where woman are only having male babies. In the first book our heroine escapes the captors who are using her to try and find the cure to this epidemic.</p>

    <p>In this second book she attempts to take down what is known as the Fea Trade....where men gather and fight to the death for the chance to claim young women who have been taken from their homes.</p>

    <p>I wasn't sure how they were going to set up the catch for the third book...but BLAM...they lay on two pages at the end that have me counting down until the next book comes out!</p>

    <p>Again, I recommend this book to those who like dystopian novels like Hunger Games or Divergent.</p>
