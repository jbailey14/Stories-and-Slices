      <p>I finished the book Shift this weekend. It is the second book in the Wool Omnibus series. Holy cow! I thought the first book, Wool, was good...but this one gives you all the back story to the first book.</p>

    <p>It is about government corruption, manipulation and power. It shows just how close we could be to everything falling down around us. I've wanted to talk about this book with a lot of people as I've been reading it AND watching the political circus we currently have going on. This book describes what might happen in a worst case scenario, but it's not too hard to imagine one little cog falling in the wrong place and having these scenarios play out.</p>

    <p>I highly recommend this book! You would have to read the first book to really understand everything in this one. And there is a 3rd and final book to the series. But I think they are captivating and quick reads. Go pick up Wool today!</p>
