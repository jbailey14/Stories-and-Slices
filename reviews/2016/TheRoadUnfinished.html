      <h3>9/6/2016 - The Road</h3>
      <img src=" http://placehold.it/300x200" alt="" />
  
      <p>Finished The Road by Cormac McCarthy (another from my 2016 reading challenge).</p>

    <p>I have a lot of mixed feelings about whether I liked the book or not. It is the story of a man and his son who live in a post apocalyptic world that has burned to the ground. They must travel the road looking for their next meal and staying away from those that mean to do them harm.</p>

    <p>I think there are some amazing portions of the book that make one think about the strain between the body's physical capabilities and the sheer power of the will to live. BUT, I found this book VERY hard to get through. The story line itself was alright, but in the middle of talking about what this father/son duo is doing you'll get an overly poetic description of the scene around them. With words and sentences often not quite making sense. I found myself reading portions more than once or twice, just to try and understand what he was meaning to get across.</p>

    <p>I also read No Country for Old Men (same author) for this summer's beer and book club. It was also not an easy read, but I found it much more appealing and easier to get through compared to this book.</p>

    <p>The Road doesn't come highly recommended by me. But I suppose if you like McCarthy's writing style or a book that is challenging...then you might like this one and should give it a try.</p>

      <p class="pr">A pizza place you've never tried, so figure you ought to, and then say "well I've tried it, but I think I'll stick to my favorite local joint."</p>
