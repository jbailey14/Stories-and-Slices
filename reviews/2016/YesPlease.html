      <h3>8/17/2016 - Yes Please!</h3>

      <p>Just finished Yes Please by Amy Poehler. I'm not one to typically pick up autobiographies but I did because it was on my 2016 reading challenge list.</p>

    <p>This book was funny and insightful. It has some really great messages and she has lead an interesting life to date. The downfalls? I'm the type to like a chronological story and she tends to jump all over the place (not that I expected more from someone with her level of energy). It wasn't so bad that I would say I didn't enjoy the book...but it's not my preference in storytelling. I would also say I would have enjoyed the book (or any autobiography for that matter) more if I had followed her career more closely or knew most of the people she was talking about.</p>

    <p>Overall, I really liked this autobiography. I've always liked Poehler's stuff and knew she would bring her humor into her writing. I would recommend this book to people who: </p>

    <ol>
    <li>like autobiographies</li>
    <li>like Amy Poehler</li>
    <li>are doing the 2016 reading challenge</li>
    </ol>

      <p class="pr">A 3 topping pizza with ingredients sporadically placed so you don't get all 3 toppings on every piece.</p>
