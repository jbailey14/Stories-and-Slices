      <h3>8/19/2016 - World War Z</h3>
      <img src=" http://placehold.it/300x200" alt="" />
  
      <p>Just finished the last book for my 2016 summer book club. We read World War Z by Max Brooks. Holy taledo, what a great book. This is written as a collection of oral history interviews of those who survived the zombie world war. The level of detail this guy takes is amazing...and he does it without bogging you down in too much information. It covers social, political, religious, and environmental aspects and really makes you think about ALL the details that go into survival.</p>

    <p>This is a book EVERYONE should read. It's thought provoking and fun. Please pick it up. I now plan on reading the other book by the same author: The Zombie Survival Guide.</p>

    <p>I've also added a song that is used in the book to pump up the soldiers about to take on millions of Zedheads. I actually listened to it WHILE reading that passage....it really heightened the experience. (add song The Trooper by Iron Maiden) </p>
      
      <h4>Malia's Pizza Rating</h4>
      
      <p class="pr">An extra large pizza that you don't have to share with the living OR the undead....with extra cheese to hold everything together.</p>
