      <h3>3/10/2016 - The Girl on the Train</h3>
      <img src=" http://placehold.it/300x200" alt="" />
  
      <p>I finished The Girl on the Train today. It was very good. It's, again, a mystery novel (they are some of my favorite). But this one had a different approach than most. The woman who witnessed the crime can't remember what happened that night....and only puts it together in flashes of memory. There were many times throughout the book where I was utterly frustrated with the choices the characters made, and was thinking how I didn't like that about the book. But the more I got to thinking about it, I think it is the best part of this novel. It's what people in real life do. It's why a lot of murders or crimes aren't open and shut cases. People lie, hide the worst of themselves, and try to protect those that they love. I think this was a book anyone could enjoy.</p>
