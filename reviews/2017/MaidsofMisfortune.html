      <h3>1/30/2017 - Maids of Misfortune: A Victorian San Francisco Mystery</h3>
      <img src=" http://placehold.it/300x200" alt="" />
  
      <p>Another book review comin' at cha:</p>

    <p>I read Maids of Misfortune which is a mystery/suspense novel set in the late 1800's where a woman who is a financial consultant has a client who "commits suicide." She knows him well enough to believe it was murder and even goes so far as to pretend to be a housemaid in the deceased's home to figure out who did it. </p>

    <p>This is what I would call a cozy mystery. The book is a page-turner, but it isn't much in the thriller category. I quite enjoyed the story line and the author's writing style. I found myself flying through it and to be almost finished before I even knew it. I will be picking up the other Victorian mysteries by the same author.

    <p>I highly recommend this book for those who love the game Clue or the TV show Murder She Wrote. This will be right up your alley.</p>
      
      <h4>Malia's Pizza Rating</h4>
      
      <p class="pr">Brick oven pizza - like the 1880's would have done.</p>
