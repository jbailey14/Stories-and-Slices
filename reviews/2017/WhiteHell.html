      <h3>5/3/2017 - White Hell by Remington Kane</h3>
      <img src=" http://placehold.it/300x200" alt="" />
  
      <p>I quickly finished the book White Hell. It fit into the category of “A book set in the Wilderness” on my reading challenge. It is book 17 in a pulp thriller series that follows an assassin named Tanner. I usually don’t pick up books in the middle of a series, but these are stand-alone pieces so you aren’t left hanging, and it perfectly fit a category on my checklist so I thought “Why the heck not?”</p>

    <p>In this volume, Tanner and his love interest go down in a plane in the Siberian wilderness. Only, it wasn’t an accident…it is payback. Now he is being hunted down and has to try and turn the tables on the brute squad that is sent to end him.</p>

    <p>This was a brisk read and full of action. I definitely felt that there were other books that spent time developing story lines that were referenced in this novel, but it wasn’t so important to the current story line that a reader would feel lost picking up this book as a starting point in the series.</p> 
    
    <p>Overall it was great on stealth, combat, and excitement. It has quite a lot of violence (warning for those who shy away from this category) and was fairly predictable, but I found it to still be a satisfying read.</p>

    <p>I would only recommend this book to hard core thriller/suspense fans and people who like movies like Borne Identity or James Bond.</p>
