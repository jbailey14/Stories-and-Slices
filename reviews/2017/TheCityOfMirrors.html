      <h3>3/6/2017 - The City of Mirrors – Justin Cronin</h3>
      <img src=" http://placehold.it/300x200" alt="" />
  
      <p>I finished the third book in the trilogy The Passage. I didn’t like it very much. After three books (all of which are over 600 pages) I got tired of Cronin’s deus ex machine style of writing; this is where an unexpected power or event saves a seemingly hopeless situation. In this type of book, somebody should suffer.  Some people die, but it’s all very nicely wrapped in a bow. For example, Peter does turn into a viral after being bitten by Zero (the original man to contract the virus and turn into a vampire). So Peter is now a soldier of Zero’s army and Zero tries to make Peter kill his love, Amy, as his ultimate vengeance. So he directs Peter to kill Amy and he has to do what Zero says…but love is so strong within Peter that he remembers who he is…billions of other fucking virals can’t remember who they were before infection….but Peter </p>

    <p>LOVES</p> 

    <p>AMY</p> 

    <p>SO</p> 

    <p>MUCH</p>

    <p>that he remembers that he loves Amy and won’t kill her. Everything else that the book is based on..fucking out the window…because love is so strong with JUST THESE TWO PEOPLE. That’s a shit wrap up…let people die or be happy, and don’t let everyone be happy…because that’s a shit vampire book too. Some main characters have to die…and some did…but in a very happy way.</p>

    <p>He could have written the final battle better, and the epilogue better. The best part of this book is the first half. And I LOVED the first half. It was the entire back-story of Zero. When he was young, going to an Ivy League school, and meeting a woman who he falls madly in love with who dies of a life long disease. This is why he on expedition in Bolivia in the first book where he contracts the virus. That part of the storyline coming full circle was really cool. Everything else was very anticlimactic…ESPECIALLY for as long as I waited to read the third book of this trilogy.</p>
