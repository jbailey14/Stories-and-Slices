      <h3>2/13/2017 - The Things They Carried by Tim O’Brien</h3>
      <img src=" http://placehold.it/300x200" alt="" />
  
      <p>I wrote a book review awhile ago about The Things They Carried. I said it was so bad I couldn't finish it and a couple people whose opinions I respect said they really liked it....so I gave it another shot. It's about the memories of a Vietnam war veteran and how he struggles to wade through the good, bad, and ugly of the war.
      
    <p>The first time I dove into this book it was an audible recording. I can honestly say that this wasn't the kind of book that was easy to follow in hard copy...so I think the reason I quite it that first time was because it was not a great choice for an audio book. </p>

    <p>I can't say I fully turned around and ended up loving this book the second time. I think it's just my personality, but I really don't like authors that jump all over a story line. O'Brien would be telling a story about the middle of the war, then tell a story about the first couple days he was there, and then tell a story about his days after the war. What I CAN say about this writing style is that I think it lent itself to the main theme in the book which was chaos and confusion.That no war story is fully true or false.</p>
 
    <p>I would recommend this book to people who really like war stories or who like the details of the Vietnam war in particular. I still think there are better novels out there covering the same subject though.</p>
      
      <h4>Malia's Pizza Rating</h4>
      
      <p class="pr">No pizza, because war is hard, dirty, and there is no time for pizza. (Make pizza, not war)</p>
