      <h3>6/27/2017 - Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs by Judi Barrett</h3>
      <img src=" http://placehold.it/300x200" alt="" />
  
      <p>The challenge was to read “A book about food.” I knew I wasn’t interested in an exposé like Fast Food Nation or Food Politics; I’m sure those are great reads, but were a little denser than I was in the mood for. So I found something light hearted and carefree. I picked up Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs! This is a children’s book where the Grandpa tells a bedtime story of a people who live in a land where the weather pours out food from the sky. But what will happen to these foodies when the cuisine won’t stop rushing down?</p>

    <p>This is a quick and enjoyable read. I couldn’t help but think as I read it, of how truly creative of a story line the writer had come up with. As a lover of food I can say I drooled over the idea of spaghetti falling from the sky. The illustrations by Ron Barrett are enchanting and whimsical. The only negative assessment that I have of this book is that it wraps up way to quickly. I know it’s a kid’s book…so it has to wrap up fast enough to keep their attention, but I found myself lost enough in the concept of the book that I wanted to hear more about how the people lived and the adventures they could potentially find themselves in. I think it would have made a great chapter book for a slightly older audience.</p>

    <p>I would recommend this book to anyone who is stuck reading oodles of books to children and especially to those creative and bold enough to perhaps diverge into telling your own stories with the same land as inspiration.</p>
