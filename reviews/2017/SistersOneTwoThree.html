      <h3>1/25/2017 - Sisters One, Two, Three</h3>
      <img src=" http://placehold.it/300x200" alt="" />
  
      <p>New book review; I finished Sisters One, Two, Three today. It is about a family who experience a brutal loss as children and how that has shaped their family (and themselves) as adults.</p>

    <p>It was decent. I found myself frustrated with many of the characters and their choices throughout the book. I have to realize people with these personalities exist, but I don't really understand their thought processes. There are also questions left unanswered in the end and that always frustrates me.</p>

    <p>Overall the read was enjoyable; I would recommend this book to people who appreciate watching a person's journey unfold in a story, or enjoy soul-searching type books.</p>
      
      <h4>Malia's Pizza Rating</h4>
      
      <p class="pr">Lobster pizza (as a portion of the book takes place in Martha's Vineyard). </p>
