      <h3>3/30/2017 - Not Alone by Craig A Falconer</h3>
      <img src=" http://placehold.it/300x200" alt="" />
  
      <p>I finished Not Alone. It’s an alien conspiracy novel…but really it’s SO much more! It was REALLY REALLY good. The basic story line is about a socially awkward man who finds himself in the middle of a robbery. The items being stolen are top secret files from a government agency. When the culprit leaves, the protagonist finds a folder that has been left behind…one that holds proof that aliens exist. As a believer himself, he decides to expose the truth.</p>

    <p>What I loved about the book is that by the time I was finished with 50%, and thinking that the story line was about run it’s course, there were multiple twists that had me with my jaw open. The author does a great job of making you feel like you know exactly what’s going on…but then he shows you that you really had no idea what was going on the whole time. To the last part I was thinking, “What is going on here?” It’s a good page-turner, well written, and the characters are likeable.</p>

    <p>I recommend this book to those who like conspiracy books, sci-fi, or just something that is off the beaten path but are looking for a good read.</p>
