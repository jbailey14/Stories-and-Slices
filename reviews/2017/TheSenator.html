      <h3>3/4/2017 - The Senator by Ken Fite</h3>
      <img src=" http://placehold.it/300x200" alt="" />
  
      <p>The book that I finished a few days ago was called The Senator. Amazon said this book fits my 2017 reading challenge “espionage thriller” and it was all right. In the end, I didn’t really think it was an espionage book though. When I was finished I was thinking…”uh…no.”

    <p>Federal agent and Ex-Navy SEAL, Blake Jordan, is assigned to protect the new republican presidential candidate when he is kidnapped right from underneath him. Now he feels personally responsible for finding the missing senator, not only because it’s his job, but also because he knows the senator personally. Will he find his mentor before he is executed in front of a national audience?</p>

    <p>I liked the book because it was a pretty good page-turner. The classic who-dun-it and what’s their motive kind of novel. The main thing I really didn’t like about it was that there was a point in the book where he gets himself back into the good graces of the FBI in order to help finish investigating the case. So while he has all these resources at his hands…he decides to go rouge. He’s such a fucking man’s man…that he has to do this on his own. Without anyone’s help. To prove something? Wouldn’t you think that once you solve the case, you’d send a chopper to save the senator? The guys got like 30 minutes before the senator is going to be executed…and he drives there by himself without anyone else’s knowledge! * Insert eye roll * You know…rather than bringing the whole team in and share the glory. </p>

    <p>The other thing that frustrated me is that it wasn’t an espionage book. I don’t want to go into too much detail, because I don’t want to give away the plot….but the motive for the kidnapping is NOT espionage. Maybe that shouldn’t blemish whether I liked the book or not, but at the same time, the reason I picked it was for that category and then it failed to fit the requirement...so that adds to my frustration but it probably wouldn’t for others.</p>

    <p>I recommend this book to people who like thrillers or mysteries…otherwise, there’s better out there.</p>
