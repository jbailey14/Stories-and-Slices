      <h3>2/27/2017 - Furiously Happy</h3>
      <img src=" http://placehold.it/300x200" alt="" />
  
      <p>This book is written by a woman from Texas who blogs about her funny life stories and also her debilitating depression and how she tries to deal with it. Her coined term is Furiously Happy; when you live your good days to their fullest in order to get through those dark times and remember what the sunny days are like, and that they’ll be back again.</p>

    <p>I can’t say it enough…I LOVED this book! She is funny, crazy, and absolutely raw in discussing her mental illnesses. The vast majority of the book is short stories about the crazy shit she pulls, like midnight cat/raccoon rodeos, traveling to Australia in order to hug a koala while wearing a koala suit, and starting an argument with her husband that turns into talking about George Washington’s dildo. This hilarity is balanced by a small portion of the book that is pretty dark. She tells us, as best she can, about what it is like to have depression, anxiety and other mental illnesses that are so overwhelming that she can’t get out of bed for days on end. It’s always so disheartening to listen to somebody’s journey that is THIS bad in life, but man she makes it very endearing. It helps to get a glimpse into the dark side even though you can’t quite understand it, you can at least be more knowledgeable of what someone like her goes through.</p>

    <p>This book wouldn’t be nearly as entrancing if it weren’t for Lawson’s writing style and humor. The read is intelligent and fast paced; sometimes you have to slow down and read it again in order to fully realize how funny the story is. She reminded me of Lorelai from Gilmore Girls….you have to really pay attention to keep up.</p>
 
    <p>I highly recommend this book to everyone…..EVERYONE! Some people may like the humor or crazy adventures more, while others might deeply connect with how hard it is to stay happy and fight your inner monsters.</p>
