      <h3>1/22/2016 - The Good Book: The Humanitarian Bible</h3>
      <img src=" http://placehold.it/300x200" alt="" />
  
      <p>Alright....another review. This is one that I will try to keep short, but will be hard as I have mixed feelings about it.</p>

    <p>I read a philosophy book called The Good Book: A humanist bible. It was heavy in subject and size. It's beautifully written in the style of a bible, but this approach makes it a littler harder to follow. I think there are many parts of the book that can be skimmed and others that seem to be repetitive. HOWEVER, the thought provoking meat of the book really made me think about how far I've come in my journey for knowledge and self-improvement and also how far I still have to go.</p>

    <p>I think my best take away from this book is the realization that in our day and age, we are full of opinions that are empty of wisdom, knowledge, and consideration (I am also guilty of this at times). We have come to be a society who values immediate satisfaction and distraction from betterment. We could use a course from the great philosophers on what is paramount to obtaining a good life.</p>

    <p>I would recommend this book to people looking for some soul-searching material...those who love philosophy...and those who are looking for some answers as to why people sometimes act the way they do.</p>
