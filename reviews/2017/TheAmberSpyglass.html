      <h3>7/4/2017 - The Amber Spyglass by Philip Pullman</h3>
      <img src=" http://placehold.it/300x200" alt="" />
  
      <p>I finally finished the third book in the His Dark Matter trilogy. This final book takes Lyra and Will to many worlds and beyond to help others while trying to stay out of harms way. </p>

    <p>This novel was my least favorite of the three and I had a hard time finishing it quickly. It wraps up the story quite nicely in most places but there is one storyline that abruptly ends (actually, the MAIN storyline) and I felt like it was extremely anticlimactic. With that being said, the characters are well written and easy to fall in love with.</p>

    <p>I recommend this book to young adults who like a book with a strong female lead. I would also recommend it to people who like Harry Potter or The Chronicles of Narnia.</p>
