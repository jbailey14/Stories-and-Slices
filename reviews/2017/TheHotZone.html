      <h3>7/2/2017 - The Hot Zone by Richard Preston</h3>
      <img src=" http://placehold.it/300x200" alt="" />
  
      <p>Finished The Hot Zone over the 4th of July weekend. This book fit my reading challenge for the category of “An Audiobook.” It was written in the mid 90’s and it is the true story of the origins of the Ebola virus and how it almost became an epidemic in the USA.

The book is broken into parts. The origins of the thread viruses, the monkey warehouse in Virginia that broke out with a strain of viral hemorrhagic fever, discovering the Reston virus, and a trip by the author to the cave where they believe it hibernates. I thought this book would keep me on the edge of my seat since the subject matter is so terrifying, but I found it to be tedious and boring. I was captivated while learning about the origins of the viruses and how easily they spread due to the symptoms looking exactly like the flu at first. Other then that, the author had many back-stories that were unnecessary filler and would write about details that lead you to believe that information was important and would come up again later, only to have no meaning at all. I think this book could have been cut in half and would have been more interesting and to the point.

I recommend this book to people who really love science and biology. Although, I’m sure if you looked hard enough you could find another book on the same subject that might have been written better.
