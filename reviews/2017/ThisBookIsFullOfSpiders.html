      <h3>1/12/2017 - This Book is Full of Spiders: Seriously, Dude, Don’t Touch It</h3>
      <img src=" http://placehold.it/300x200" alt="" />
  
      <p>For those of you following along, I finished a book a little while ago called John Dies at the End. It was one of my favorite books I read in 2016 hands down! Well, I just finished its sequel and I have to say...I really love this guy's writing style. It is a comic horror novel and I have to say, there are very few books that have me laughing out loud...but both these books did it.</p>

    <p>It is about two guys who live in a town where a lot of weird shit happens...and often happens to them. They aren't terribly smart, or strong, but they take on alien spiders and try to save their asses (and maybe the town if they can...but mainly their own asses). Nick Sharp's review is spot on when he says "Kevin Smith’s Clerks meets H.P. Lovecraft" (http://www.sfsignal.com/archives/2012/10/book-review-this-book-is-full-of-spiders-by-david-wong/)</p>

    <p>I recommend this to everyone! It can be a little scary. And there is a lot of violence for those who are squeamish. But if those things don't faze you I think you'll really enjoy this combination of action and laughs.</p>
