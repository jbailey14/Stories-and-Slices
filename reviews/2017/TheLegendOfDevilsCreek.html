      <p>It's been a little while since I posted a book review...but hey! I was on vacation! So here's another one for you.
      
        <p>I finished The Legend of Devil's Creek today and it was a solid OK read. It's about a serial killer just North of Seattle who is killing men that have a history of spousal and child abuse. Who is the local who is exacting his revenge?</p>

        <p>The writing style was good, the read was quick..and the ending had an unusual twist...so I'm not sure why I can't say that I loved this book. The part I did like was that the author used a college philosophy class as a vehicle to discuss what makes people do bad things and why a seemingly normal person could bring themselves to act on evil thoughts.</p>
 
        <p>I would recommend this only if someone REALLY liked the mystery genre. Full disclosure: there is graphic violence.</p>
