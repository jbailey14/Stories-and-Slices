      <h3>1/5/2016 - Winter-over</h3>
      <img src=" http://placehold.it/300x200" alt="" />
  
      <p>For my next installment of the: Malia rates books for people who are curious...here is the review of The Winter-over</p>

<p>This book is a mystery/thriller about a crew who is left to WINTER-OVER (spend months without outside contact) at the South Pole's science facility. Only this year, they aren't performing experiments....they ARE the experiment. Someone has taken a stressful situation and added fear to see how people will act under extreme tension. Who is the person watching to study and record everyone's reactions?</p>

<p>I really liked this book...until about the last 20%. It didn't end in complete disaster...but I found myself bored with the reading all the sudden (right when the arc of the story should have had me burning through pages). It felt hurried and jumbled. Up until this point though..I was incredibly interested.</p>

<p>I would recommend this book only to those who read a lot and like thrillers, etc. Otherwise, I think there are better books out there to have you flying through the pages to see what happens next.</p>
      
      <h4>Malia's Pizza Rating</h4>
      
      <p class="pr">MRE (meal ready to eat) pizza. If you're stuck in the -80 degree winter...you still need your pizza fix!</p>
