      <h3>6/1/2017 - A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman</h3>
      <img src=" http://placehold.it/300x200" alt="" />
  
      <p>I finished the book A Man Called Ove. The review said I would laugh, cry, and feel sympathy for the curmudgeons of the world. I made it to the last couple chapters of the book and thought to myself “I laughed, and I could identify with the old man’s view of the world, but I haven’t cried yet.” I was proud of myself at that point because that is not my typical M.O. Fuck those last chapters! The last chapters were a total cry fest for me. And I was doing this at work, which was not so great.</p> 

    <p>It follows the life of a man in Sweden named Ove (ooh-ve). He is a cantankerous man who has had a hard life and who has just recently lost his wife. He now has shut himself away and is waiting to die. Along comes a new energetic neighbor who refuses to take his bad attitude as a sign that he wants to be left alone. Over the course of the book it gives you a glimpse into his life and what has happened to make him so bitter, it also shows how persistent caring from the people around him melts his hard exterior and allows him to find a happy life after his wife’s death.</p>

    <p>It’s a feel good story and I really enjoyed watching Ove take a journey of self-discovery. It shows how much we can affect one another and how much our interactions could mean to others. It’s also a reminder to not pass judgment when we see people who are angry or jaded because maybe they have gone through some pretty rough times to get that wall built up. Keep trying, sometimes the person that hurts you the most and says how much they don’t want you needs you more than you might know.</p>

    <p>I would recommend this book if you liked the movie St. Vincent or like a book where the protagonist gets a second chance at happiness.</p>
