      <h3>1/13/2017 - The Life-Changing Magic of Not Giving a F*ck: How to Stop Spending Time You Don’t Have with People You Don’t Like Doing Things You Don’t Want to Do</h3>

      <p>Finished a book yesterday and think many people could use it. It's called The Life-Changing Magic of Not Giving a F**K.</p>

    <p>I'm not really about reading self-help books, but this is something I've been working on for the last couple of years and it sounded funny. I feel like the overall message and the process of accomplishing it is pretty helpful. But, like many self help books, I felt like things were repeated way too often and that the wording was confusing at times. I think this comes down to the fact that these authors are trying to get in so many therapy techniques into a short amount of pages, that it muddles the message. </p>

    <p>With that being said, I think we all care too much about what others think and weigh our lives down with obligations to others. It's a good book that is quite short and helps you to rethink how we dole out our giving of f**ks. If you have time I say give the thing a read.</p>
