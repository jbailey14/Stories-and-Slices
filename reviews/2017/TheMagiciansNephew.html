      <h3>The Magician’s Nephew (Chronicles of Narnia: Book 1) By: C.S. Lewis</h3>
      <img src=" http://placehold.it/300x200" alt="" />
  
      <p>On the way to Hawaii I finished The Magician’s Nephew, which is the first book in The Chronicles of Narnia Series. These books are easy to finish, and is my favorite childhood series, so I tend to finish the set once every 3-5 years. I pulled them out again because one of the 2017 Reading Challenges calls for “A book you loved as a child.” </p>

    <p>This first novel is about two neighbor children who play together through their summer vacation. On one day of exploring, they end up in one of the kids’ crazy uncle’s study. The uncle finds the children admiring sets of sparkly rings. He encourages them to try the rings on. Little do they know the rings are magical and will transport them to other worlds. The rest of the book covers their adventures discovering these other places. </p>

    <p>What I love about these books is that they never get old; you give it a little bit of time away from them, and then they’re just as good when you read them again. Over the years the book that obviously gets the most hype is The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. While that book is also very good, this is the book that is my favorite in the series. This is the origin story of Narnia and also lets you see how many other realms there are. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read…and even those who don’t. The writing is easy to follow along, the book length is not bad, and it is family friendly. Adventure awaits!</p>
