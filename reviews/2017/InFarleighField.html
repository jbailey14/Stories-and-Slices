      <h3>4/24/2017 - In Farleigh Field by Rhys Bowen</h3>
      <img src=" http://placehold.it/300x200" alt="" />
  
      <p>I finished In Farleigh Field, which met my 2017 reading challenge criteria of “a book published in 2017.” Set during World War II, the novel is a whodunit full of mystery and conspiracy when an unknown man falls from the sky with a parachute that doesn’t open, an outdated military outfit, and a cryptic photo with a coded message. Who sent him and for what purpose? The aristocratic cast of characters are secretly sent on separate missions to find out.</p>

    <p>The thing I liked most about the book is that throughout the novel you are given bits of information that make you suspect each character’s loyalty at least once. You debate if the information given could make them the partner spy of the dead parachuter. It’s been a little while for me to have sat down with a book and not wanted to put it down…but this was that kind of book for me. I was reminded of the Agatha Christie cozy mysteries as I read it.  They aren’t gruesome, they’re just a great suspense novel where you don’t know who the villain is until the very end. After looking up more information about the author, I found out she has a few different series of books. I will definitely be picking many of those up down the line to see if they are just as good as this one was.</p>

    <p>I would recommend In Farleigh Field to people who like Agatha Christi, Murder She Wrote or Clue.</p>
      
      <h4>Malia's Pizza Rating</h4>
      
      <p class="pr">The Renato Viola Creation  —  $12,000 Topped with bufala mozzarella, three types of caviar, lobster from Norway and Cilento, and it is lightly dusted with hand picked grains of pink Australian sea-salt from the Murray River. The cost includes service (thank God), and this pie can only be made in your home. That’s right, three Italian chefs will show up at your villa and make it for you in the comfort of your kitchen. <a href="http://hauteliving.com/2010/03/top-five-most-expensive-pizzas-in-the-world/29487/">Check it out!</a></p>
