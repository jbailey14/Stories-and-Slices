      <h3>5/16/2017 - The New Jim Crow by Michelle Alexander</h3>
      <img src=" http://placehold.it/300x200" alt="" />
  
      <p>The reading challenge was “Pick a book about a difficult topic”… boy did I ever! I read The New Jim Crow. It is a book that discusses the theory that our political and judicial system has created a caste system that has kept African Americans in modern day slavery. To do this they have technically taken race out and replaced it with the word “criminal.” But just like the old Jim Crow laws, our current system makes sure that crimes that are labeled “black” are punished more harshly, that sentencing is far from impartial, and that even after serving time in prison many of their basic rights are taken away.</p>

    <p>This book dives into the history of slavery, the old Jim Crow laws, and the start of the War on Drugs and mass incarceration. It then breaks down the different stages of the incarceration process from policing with motivation to book people on drug charges because of funding incentives, to prosecution having the power to drop charges or pile on more charges in order to get an individual to agree to a plea deal. Then there is the decrease in power for judges who are obligated to sentence with the mandatory minimum laws, even if they do not agree. And finally, the author addresses the hardships that ex-convicts face once they are released which are, many times, insurmountable.</p>

    <p>I very much liked this book, even though it was a demanding read. Once you’ve had your eyes opened to this system, there is no closing them. I will not see movies, advertising, or news without thinking about these facts. I’m glad to have read it, glad I’ve seen something from another’s viewpoint, and am excited to talk about this topic with anyone who is interested…and maybe gently prod those who aren’t willing to see this failure of justice. The only complaint I have for the writing is that about 60% of the way through I thought it became a bit redundant. Otherwise it was a solid book!</p>

    <p>I recommend this book to EVERYONE. It’s time to educate ourselves and stand up for other’s rights even when ours aren’t under threat of revoke.</p>
      
      <h4>Malia's Pizza Rating</h4>
      
      <p class="pr">The gut rot pizza: extra sauce, onions, pepperoni, fresh tomatoes, and hot peppers. It will make your stomach churn.</p>
