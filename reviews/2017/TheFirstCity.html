      <p>I finally finished the last book in The Dominion Trilogy. I felt like I wasn’t going to like it because it was so slow moving in the beginning. This struck me as weird since the ending of the second book leaves you with such a great cliffhanger. There is action at the beginning of the book, but I wasn’t really sucked into the story line until about half way through. I would also say that there were moments of frustration with the lead character because she has a bit of a martyr complex. BUT, the second half of the book is so good, that I ended up loving it! I think that certain parts were a bit predictable, while others were a shock to me..so there was a good balance there. My favorite part was the way the author wrapped everything up. Mainly because I like it when a writer has enough guts to not end the book on a happy note. Especially when it’s a dystopian novel…shit’s gonna happen man! Not to say that I wasn’t sad that everyone didn’t get what they wanted in the end… It’s just more realistic. Overall, I very much liked the final book for this trilogy.

    <p>I would recommend it for people who like dystopian novels or movies. I would also recommend it to people who like a strong female lead.</p>
