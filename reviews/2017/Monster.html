      <h3>3/2/2017 - Monster by Walter Dean Myers</h3>
      <img src=" http://placehold.it/300x200" alt="" />
  
      <p>I finished the book Monster the other day. This is a book I remember kids reading in junior high but I never did. It's the story of a black male teenager who is on trial for murder. What makes it unique is that it is set up as a screenplay written by the protagonist while he is on trial.</p>
      
    <p>I don't want to dismiss this book and say that I really just didn't like it. But as I read it AND as I thought about it for a day afterward, I had so many questions. I could see there being so many different ways a reader could interpret parts of the book. It's one that I would have rather discussed as a book club. There are questions that range from "Does this book gain or loose something by being written as a screenplay?" to "How do you feel about the racial overtones that are touched upon by those incarcerated with the main character?"</p>

    <p>This was a fast read, and I personally didn't love the set up of the book. The narrative was captivating and it was a very quick read (I did it in a day). I would say this is a great book for young adults and book clubs.</p>

      <p class="pr">The most delicious pizza you can imagine...a pizza that tastes as good as freedom...because you're imagining it....while stuck behind bars on trial for murder.</p>
