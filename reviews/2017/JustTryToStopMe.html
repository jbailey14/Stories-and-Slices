      <h3>3/7/2017 - Just Try to Stop Me by Gregg Olsen</h3>
      <img src=" http://placehold.it/300x200" alt="" />
  
      <p>I finished Just Try to Stop Me last night. It’s about a woman who escapes prison and has a goal to become one of the most notorious female serial killers in history. Now detective Stark in on a mission to find this crazed killer before she takes another victim.</p>

    <p>The storyline itself is quite good. It keeps you guessing throughout and gives a nice twist at the end. There was only one thing on the cons side of this novel, because I really liked it, and it’s that it was just a bit anti-climactic. There was so much lead up to the final show down and then….The End. There is a short epilogue that gives a quick blurb about what happens to each main character later. They seemed very choppy and lack luster. I was happy that the author didn’t just leave the reader to wonder what happened, but it was so short. It left you with a feeling of being unresolved even tough they gave some small closure. It left me feeling like they chopped it off too quickly. Everything else about the book was great…a little brutal, probably not recommended for those who don’t like gruesome deaths, etc.</p>
