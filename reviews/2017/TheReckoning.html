      <h3>2/6/2017 - The Reckoning</h3>
      <img src=" http://placehold.it/300x200" alt="" />
  
      <p>Here's a fun new book review in a genre I don't normally read! I read The Reckoning, which is a Western. </p>


    <p>I'll be honest, at first I didn't know if I would be able to finish the book. The writing seemed kitchy and they would like you to believe that a custom made gun in 2002 magically disappears when a 14 year old in 1876 needs it and it wondrously appears in his barn.</p>


    <p>BUT... once the first chapter about magic time traveling guns is over, the rest of the book focuses on how the 14 year old seeks revenge on the three men that brutally killed his family. On this journey he becomes the fastest draw in the West and takes out the bad guys along the trail. This main part of the book was engrossing and I couldn't wait to see what trouble would surface in the next town he stopped in.</p>


    <p>Warning: this book was very violent and there is rape in it. If you can handle that, then I thought this was a very engaging book and was a fun departure into another genre that I rarely seek out. I would recommend it if you like John Wayne movies or the like. This main character has an entire series that I plan on continuing at some point.</p>
