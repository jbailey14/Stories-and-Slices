      <h3>4/28/2017 - The Stepford Wives by Ira Levin</h3>
      <img src=" http://placehold.it/300x200" alt="" />
  
      <p>I finished The Stepford Wives. The reason I picked this one up was because it checked off the box on my reading challenge of “A book mentioned in another book.” The author that wrote The Princess Bride also does screenplays and happened to do the one for The Stepford Wives. I know there is a movie out there, and I haven’t seen it yet. When I looked it up on Amazon, I thought the synopsis was creepy enough for me to find it interesting.</p> 

    <p>It’s about a family that moves out of the city and into the suburbs during the 70’s. This town has the outward appearance of the perfect all-American life. Clique picket white fences, children, and friendly neighbors. After awhile, the protagonist finds she is having a hard time making friends with the other women in town. They are too busy cleaning their homes day and night. The men all join The Men’s Association, but the women are made to stay home and work. She begins to feel there is something wrong with the women in this town and won’t give up investigating until she finds out exactly what it is. Without giving away the end, I can tell you the reveal is seriously messed up! I’ll never look at the “perfect housewife” the same way.</p>

    <p>I finished this book in a day; it’s a very easy read. It’s captivating and the story line develops quickly. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to know about a cult classic or for someone who doesn’t read a lot but would like an easy book. I’ll definitely be picking up the movie soon….I’m interested to see how they interpreted this book to film.</p>
