      <h3>6/7/2017 - Uneasy Spirits by M. Louisa Locke</h3>
      <img src=" http://placehold.it/300x200" alt="" />
  
      <p>I just finished Uneasy Spirits, which is a stand-alone sequel to Maids of Misfortune. These books are part of a larger series called The Victorian San Francisco Mystery series. In this book the protagonist finds herself investigating the corrupt practices of a spiritual medium duo that is swindling people out of their money and using blackmail if they don’t comply. What Annie doesn’t know is that there is a murder tied to the charlatans and they will do whatever it takes to keep her from finding out their secret.

    <p>I thought this was a very good sequel to the first novel. It was full of mystery, thrills, and quirky characters. I like that the main character’s story line picked up right where they left off from the first novel, but I honestly liked the plot of the first book better. This one had a lot of séances and spiritualism in it where you didn’t find out there was a murder being covered up until almost the end of the book. The first one was much more of a murder mystery from the beginning when a man is murdered and Annie takes it upon herself to find out who did it. These aren’t the most incredible novels ever written, but they are fun and fast reads. They are in the genre of cozy mysteries and I think that is an adequate description of them.</p>

    <p>I would recommend this book to those who like Columbo type TV shows.</p>
