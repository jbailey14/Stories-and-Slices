      <p>New book review!</p>

    <p>I just finished Gone the Next; a book about an insurance fraud investigator who is on a stakeout when he notices a girl in the house he's watching. The catch? This little girl is all over the news and has been missing for 24 hours.</p>

    <p>The overarching story is quite captivating. You're always wondering what information is going to pop up in the next chapter that will help solve the case. I did not like, however, that the protagonist does as he pleases with no regard for procedures, the law, or the current police investigation surrounding the disappearance. All of that with no consequences. </p>

    <p>Overall I would say it's solidly an ok book. Nothing knocked out of the park, but for someone like me who really burns through thriller/mysteries, it's worth reading. I also think I'm starting to read enough of these that others would find them quite good...but it's taking a lot for me to give books in this genre 5 stars.</p>
