      <h3>6/17/17 - The Golden Compass by Philip Pullman</h3>
      <img src=" http://placehold.it/300x200" alt="" />
  
      <p>I finished a book that has been on my reading to-do list for FAR too long (which is the category I checked off on my reading challenge). So now it’s time to review The Golden Compass! It’s a steam punk novel that is also magical. Humans have souls that manifest outside their bodies in animal form, there are witch clans at war, and a race of warrior bears who have a royal revolution happening in their frozen lands. Things get shaken up when, unexpectedly, there is a kidnapping epidemic sweeping through Europe. The protagonist, Lyra, is a young girl who is trying to find where children are being taken, and for what purpose. What she finds is much more disturbing than she could ever have imagined. Can she save the missing children from peril?</p>

    <p>This book took a little while for me to get into it, but once the mysterious secrets started boiling to the surface I was hooked. I speed through the story and couldn’t wait to find out what was going to happen next. The writing is smooth and weaves a charmed tale. There are questions I had when the book ended…but I’m going to quickly start the next book in the trilogy hoping to get some of the answers.</p>

    <p>I would recommend this book to those who loved the Harry Potter series, especially the darker books in the later half of the story.</p>
