      <h3>6/25/2017 - American Gods by Neil Gaiman</h3>
      <img src=" http://placehold.it/300x200" alt="" />
  
      <p>Finished American Gods by Neil Gaiman in order to check off “A book based on mythology” on my reading challenge. It tells the tale of the Gods from the old country who have been brought over to America inside the minds and rituals of the many immigrants. As the years go on Americans have stopped worshiping these Gods and founded new Gods of technology, wars, media, etc. This has weakened the old Gods. Now the old and the new Gods come together in an epic battle with a winner-takes-all outcome. Who will be left standing in the rubble? </p>

    <p>I liked the book a lot. If I were to give a criticism, it would be that I thought the book was slow to start. It took me about a quarter of the book to feel hooked into the story line. Once you get into the depth of the novel it’s really fascinating. I found myself curious as to which Gods would be in the book and how would Gaiman present them? I would say I probably also liked this book because I chose to listen to it on Audible, so there was a full cast to separate the voices for each character. Otherwise I think it could have potentially been confusing between all the characters and the scene changes. So overall, I think it was a great book, but was most likely made easier to get through as an audiobook.</p>

    <p>I would recommend it to people who like Norse mythology, Neil Gaiman as an author, or Homer’s Odyssey.</p>
