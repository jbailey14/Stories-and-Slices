      <h3>3/16/2017 - The 9th Hour by Claire Stibbe</h3>

      <p>I’m doing a book review on a book called The 9th Hour. It’s supposed to be a murder mystery. I can’t tell you what it’s about…because I didn’t finish the book it was so bad. From what I could gather, it’s a book about a serial killer who was trying to exact revenge (or make amends) for killing his brother? I couldn’t actually tell who killed the brother. I pushed through and finished 30% of this book, and on almost every page I would be reading along and thinking that they were talking about character A…and by the end of the paragraph, without transitioning, the author is talking about Character B. I couldn’t get to the end of this book, and I tried really hard. I was straining though it because my theory was that the person that was killing women had a multiple personality disorder. And if that’s not the case, that’s a really fucking bad author, because the killer HAD a multiple personality disorder simply through the confusing writing…you could not follow along. And it wasn’t just one character that was confusing to follow. On every page I would have to stop and ask, “Wait! Who’s talking now? OK wait…who’s talking now?” I just kept pushing though telling myself that I would get used to the author’s voice, or eventually the storyline will reveal itself enough that I will start to be able to separate everything. NO….NOT…..EVER! It was just so confusing. I finally went on to Amazon to look at the other reviews and I was not alone in this opinion. I hate giving up on a book..but this one was just un-readable, and I’ve pushed through some bad books. So, 18 thumbs down!</p>
