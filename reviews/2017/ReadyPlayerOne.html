      <h3>6/8/2017 - Ready Player One by Ernest Cline</h3>
      <img src=" http://placehold.it/300x200" alt="" />
  
      <p>Ready Player One is everything you want if you're a lover of the 80's. In the future we shop, learn and interact all in a virtual world. The billionaire who created this brilliant technology has a love of 80's pop culture, no heir, and has given everyone an opportunity to inherit his fortune. How? But racing against all other competitors to crack his puzzles and find the ultimate Easter egg in his virtual world.</p>


    <p>I LOVED this book! There's action and adventure as the protagonist and his friends race for fortune. It's a book that many people won't love as dearly as those of us who understand all the references to the 80's, but this author does an amazing job of weaving in this pop culture into the all consuming story-line.</p>


    <p>I would recommend this book to people who enjoyed Tron or any of the classic arcade games from this genre. I'd also recommend it to people who loved the Brat Pack.</p>
