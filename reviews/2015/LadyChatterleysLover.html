      <h3>9/14/2015 - Lady Chatterley’s Lover</h3>
      <img src=" http://placehold.it/300x200" alt="" />
  
      <p>Finished a good book this morning. I'm not much for romantic novels, but this one was on my recommended top 200 reading list. And my interests were peaked when reading the synopsis:</p>

<p>Lady Chatterley's Lover, written in 1928, tells the story of a passionate love affair between an upper class woman and her husband’s gamekeeper, which was thought to be so shocking in its content and its straightforward use of explicit sexual terms, that it was not officially published until 1960. Its 1961 second edition contained this dedication from the publisher: "For having published this book, Penguin Books were prosecuted under the Obscene Publications Act, 1959 at the Old Bailey in London from 20 October to 2 November 1960. This edition is therefore dedicated to the twelve jurors, three women and nine men, who returned a verdict of 'Not Guilty' and thus made D. H. Lawrence's last novel available for the first time to the public in the United Kingdom."</p>

<p>It's steamy even by today's standards. And all I could think when the sex scenes were being read was...I can't imagine this being written back then....SCANDALOUS! Worth the read if you like the romantic writings of Danielle Steel or appreciate how forward thinking this book was for it's time. Otherwise, probably not most people's cup of tea.
