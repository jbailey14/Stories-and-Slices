      <p>Finished a book yesterday that I bought on a recommendation from a high school English teacher. Before reviewing it...I should say I don't think I would have handled this book nearly as well at 18. It's involves very somber subject matter and I wouldn't recommend it to those who can't stomach reading about child abuse and molestation.</p>

    <p>That being said, I really enjoyed the story of a high school boy who helps a girl he barely knows attempt to escape a life of abuse. It was well written and it had me at the edge of my seat to see what would happen next. Without giving away the twists and surprises, I can't say much more. It was a good read but very intense.</p>
