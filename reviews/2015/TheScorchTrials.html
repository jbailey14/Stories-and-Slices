      <p>I finished books 2 and 3 of the Maze Runner series. Meh. As I stated in my post about the first book...it's alright, but not as good as the Hunger Games or Divergent series. The theme that was most distinct to this set was deception. You were always wondering who was lying, who was the good guy, and that was what kept me intrigued throughout. I had the hardest time finishing the last 2/3 of the final book. The ending, to me, was lack luster and not well plotted. I think this might be one (dare I say it) that would be better just to watch the movies.</p>
