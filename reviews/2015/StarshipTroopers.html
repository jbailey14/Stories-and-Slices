      <h3>7/9/2015 - Starship Troopers</h3>
      <img src=" http://placehold.it/300x200" alt="" />
  
      <p>Finished reading Starship Troopers for my book club. It's incredibly different than what I consider modern plot lines (it was published 1959). It is detailed and matter-of-fact in it's narrative flow. The protagonist finished training about halfway through the book and I'm thinking "This is where the story takes off"...but not really. Only within the last handful of pages do you see a little battle action. I think if I hadn't been able to dive into discussion at a book club and talk about the subjects found in between the lines I wouldn't have liked this book as much. The most incredible part of the novel is his creative leaps in technology for the time. Keep in mind, it is NOTHING like the film that was released in the 90's. I recommend it to people who already enjoy military type books. </p>
